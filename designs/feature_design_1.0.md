# Ticket Requirements
Feature Design: Design a list of features to include in the application, along with their basic interface layout and elements. Determine the Python Libraries/Modules/APIs to use in order to achieve the desired results. The initial Feature Design should be limited to a total of 5 features for Iteration 1.0

## List of Basic Features to Include in the Application (Limited to 5 features)
1. Be able to display a single point in space inside a rendering window.
2. Be able to display a line with points on either end inside a rendering window.
3. Be able to display a 2D polygon with points on each vertex inside a rendering window.
4. Be able to display a 3D polygon with points on each vertex inside a rendering window.
5. Be able to display a 4D object with points on each vertex inside a rendering window.

## Basic Interface Layout and Elements
- Application Window
- Title Bar with window controls
- Menu Bar
    - File
    - Edit
    - Help
    - About
- Rendering Window
- Status Bar
- Toolbar and/or Toolbox
- Properties Window
    - Properties Bar
    - Properties Panel
- Rendering Window Controls
- Realtime calculation peephole, also displaying the cursor's coordinates in the 3D space in real-time

## Python Libraries/Modules/APIs to Use
- PyQt6 - Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform application framework.
- PyOpenGL - Python bindings for the OpenGL graphics library.
- PyOpenGL-accelerate - Python bindings for the OpenGL graphics library.
- NumPy - Python library for numerical computing.
- SciPy - Python library for scientific computing.
- GLFW - Python bindings for the GLFW library.
- PyInstaller - Python library for creating standalone executables from Python scripts.
- SCons - CONSIDERATION ONLY

## Related follow-on requirements
- Update Readme.md to include the features implemented.
    - Document the hardware supported, including the operating system, CPU, and GPU.
