# physics_simulator
A hobby project designed to test my software development skills and develop them, while at the same time teaching me more about how the world and space work.

# Feature Implementation 1.0

## requirements.txt
Implemented requirements.txt for the baseline design with the following dependencies:
<UL>
<LI>PyQt6=6.7.1</LI>
<LI>PyOpenGL=3.1.7</LI>
<LI>Numpy=2.1.1</LI>
<LI>SciPy=1.14.1</LI>
<LI>GLFW=2.7.0</LI>
<LI>PyInstaller=6.10.0</LI>
</UL>

Since I'm building from scratch, I decided I might as well use the cutting edge versions as the base specs. Note that in this version, PyOpenGL_accelerate is downloaded as a built distribution to reduce other dependencies. This version only supports Windows amd64 architectures. Support for other architectures will be added in the future.
